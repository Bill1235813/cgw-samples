Sir Lancelot covers this servant .
another story drinks every pound .
Sir Lancelot carries the chalice .
another story carries a fruit .
drinks this defeater .
that coconut rides each sovereign .
no sun drinks a husk .
rides each corner .
is every corner .
another land is that land .
each sovereign is this home .
this king is the weight .
a home covers no fruit
a home carries every quest .
another swallow rides any master .
another chalice covers this castle .
any home covers no land .
no home rides no story .
each home rides any servant .
every land over that master carries this land .
