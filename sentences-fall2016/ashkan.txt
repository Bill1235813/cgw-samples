that coconut carries the sun
this swallow is a winter
each castle is no defeater above Sir Lancelot
each master has every land
any land with the chalice carries any horse
each story on Arthur covers every sun
the fruit has this corner above any pound
the sun has the chalice
any story at that corner carries any home
that chalice has a winter
every coconut drinks any king .
each castle is no defeater
no swallow carries each defeater
no land drinks this king .
another sovereign carries each horse
Sir Lancelot has no coconut .
each weight has a winter .
the defeater has no coconut
the winter drinks every swallow
another home covers each servant
