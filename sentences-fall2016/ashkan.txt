no swallow carries each defeater
another sovereign carries each horse
the sun has the chalice
any land with the chalice carries any horse
every coconut drinks any king .
the defeater has no coconut
that coconut carries the sun
that chalice has a winter
another home covers each servant
each castle is no defeater above Sir Lancelot
each story on Arthur covers every sun
each master has every land
any story at that corner carries any home
this swallow is a winter
the winter drinks every swallow
each weight has a winter .
each castle is no defeater
Sir Lancelot has no coconut .
no land drinks this king .
the fruit has this corner above any pound
